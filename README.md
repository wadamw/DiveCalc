# DiveCalc
Decompression Profile Calculator and Dive Logging Software

The ultimate goal of this software is to create a fully featured decompression calculator and dive logging software, including mixed gas and rebreather support, along with support for multiple decompression algorithms, to include custom defined Buhlmann models. 

Planned milestones:

0.1 - Air Dives using ZHL-16C
0.2 - Nitrox Dives using ZHL-16C
0.3 - Trimix Dives using ZHL-16C
0.4 - Gas Switching support
0.5 - Rebreather setpoint dives using air/nitrox/trimix using ZHL-16C
